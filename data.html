            <p> I have been sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. Unfortunately, it is common that the perpetrator is
                an intimate partner,
                while in the UK 90% of those who are raped know the perpetrator prior to the offence.
                I wouldn't wish anyone to experience what I have went through and I wish more people,
                than current 15%, would seek for help and not drown their mysery in drugs. </p>

            <p>Being woman in Nigeria is not an easy task. Every time we give birth to a child, we risking our lives.
                58 000 women die within 45 days after giving birth, due to poor medical infrastructure. What is more,
                even if you get higher education,
                and I was lucky enough to graduate from the university - you are most likely to be in a mere minority
                when at work. However,
                statistics show that women are not really welcome in parlament in many countries around the world.
                For example in UK women have only 32% of the parlament seats.</p>

            <p>I got pregnant when I was 16. The father of the kid left me after hearing the news and Iâ€™ve never heard
                back from him.
                I had to drop out from the high school to take care of my child, but I am still dreaming about going to
                college some day
                and eventually becoming an accountant. However, statistics in US show that only 2 out of 100 teen
                mothers earn a college
                degree by the age of 30.</p>
